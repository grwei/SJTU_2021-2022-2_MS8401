### [Torrence & Compo 1998](bams_79_01_0061.pdf)
A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described.

### [Torrence & Webster 1999](interdecadal.pdf)
The method of wavelet coherency is applied to the ENSO and monsoon indexes.
